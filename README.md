# Data_Management_System

This is Data_Management_System that I made in Jan 2024 to manage my mom's jewelry assets.

It provides GUI so that my mom can easily add, edit, and search her assets. When the item is double-clicked, it shows detailed information about the item that is essential for calculating its price. I haven't implemented the auto-calculating function yet, but I may continue writing later if it's needed.

The whole codes are made by ChatGPT. I just fixed a little bit of code to customize it depending on my actual data model and needs.
